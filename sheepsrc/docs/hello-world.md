# Hello

Welcome to the tutorials of Robocon 2019!

Following each of the tasks in this category will start you on your way to getting your robot doing stuff.

Ready? Let's go!

> These tutorials will always assume that you have connected to the robot,  started on the homepage and completed the previous tutorials. To find out how to connect to your robot click \*Link to the connecting docs\*

# Creating your first program

As this is the first program that your robot will run we'll make it as simple and clich√©d as it can get:

Make it say "Hello world"

## Create a new file

1. On the main page click the "Editor" button. \*Image showing the editor button\*
2. On the tabs click new file and name it something (e.g. "HelloWorld")

## Notes about writing code

There are two ways to go about writing code for the robot:

1. Blockly - A building block based language that allows you to write code with blocks. NB a python script will automatically be written along the right hand side.
2. Python.

They both work equally as well and it does not matter which one is used, it is your choice. However for the following tutorials python will be used.

Details on both these methods can be found in the programming section of the documentation.

## Writing the code

As the only thing this program will do is output a statement to the logs, we will only have to use the `print` statement.

1. In the editor window enter:


```
print("Hello world")
```

## Running the code

Returning to the main page click on the green run button.

You should now see the run interface. Choose zone zero and make sure development mode is checked. When you are ready click start.

The logs should then appear with a friendly "Hello world"
